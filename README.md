# Zopsmart_Task

A secure and ethical Hospital Patients Management system in Go. I'm managing patients, doctors, appointments, and medical records. API routes will reflect these types, allowing searching, filtering, and managing patient data. Robust error handling and security measures are key: authentication, authorization, masking sensitive data, and user-friendly error messages. My focus is a secure, efficient API that prioritizes patient privacy and ethical data handling. This API ensures a responsible and secure service for hospital patientÂ management.
This project provides a secure and ethical API for managing hospital patient data in Go. It focuses on patient privacy and responsible data handling while offering efficient functionalities for:

    Data Management: Manage patients, doctors, appointments, and medical records with CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
    Security: Implement user authentication, authorization, and data masking to protect sensitive information.
    Error Handling: Provide user-friendly error messages and handle different error types gracefully.
    Search and Filtering: Search for patients based on specific criteria and filter data efficiently.
